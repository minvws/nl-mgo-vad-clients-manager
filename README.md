## Setup and install instructions

### Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation).

### Installation

#### 1. Generate and Configure GitHub Token

This repository depends on private packages hosted on the MinVWS GitHub account.
To access these packages, you must authenticate using a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).

The token must have the following scopes:

- `repo`
- `read:packages`

Once you have generated your token, store it in an `auth.json` file.
The recommended location for this file is:
`~/.config/composer/auth.json` (Composer's global configuration directory)
Alternatively, you may place the `auth.json` file in the root of the project.

Example: **auth.json**:

```json

{
    "github-oauth": {
        "github.com": "your_github_token_here"
    }
}
```

#### 2. Clone and Initialize the Project

Clone this repository and run in the root of your project:

  ```bash
  task init
  ```
  
This will do the following:
- Copy the .env.example to .env
- Install the composer dependencies
- Start the docker containers
- Generate a new application key
- Run the migrations and seed the database
- Install the frontend dependencies
- Build the frontend assets
- Create an admin user
Note: In the output there will be a link present to finish the registration of the admin user before you can login

#### 3. Start the Application

The next time, if you want to simply start the application without initialization, run the following command:

```bash
task up
```

So what the `task init` does is to prepare your environment from scratch, so it does all kind of installations, prepopulates the database,
creates an admin user and has also the container `nl-mgo-vad-clients-manager` up and running.
In case you don't have any radical updates to run and you simply want to run the application, then you 'd better use the `task up` command.

#### 4. Stopping the Application

To stop the containers you can run the following command:

```bash
task stop
```

### Troubleshooting
* If you want to pre-populate the db with seeded data, you can run in your terminal the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
```

* If you want to manually install the `php composer`, then
in your terminal do `./vendor/bin/sail shell`. This will allow you to interact with the Laravel Sail container, which is the
default Docker development environment. Sail provides a lightweight command-line interface for managing various aspects
of your Laravel application's Docker containers.
Inside that container you can now run `composer install`.


## Default configuration

### Cache driver
When you first install the project the default cache driver is set to `file` instead of `database`. After your first
install you can switch this in the `.env` by changing the `CACHE_STORE` variable. The `file` driver is not recommended
for production environments.

For other driver options see the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/cache#configuration).

### Session driver
The default session driver is set to `database` via the `SESSION_DRIVER` variable in the `.env`. This is recommended
for production environments. For other driver options see the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/session#configuration).


### Creating user

After you've set up the project you can create a user by running the following command:

```bash
vendor/bin/sail artisan user:create-admin
```

This will guide you to create a new admin user by asking for an email address and name. You can also provide the email
and name as parameters to the command.

```bash
vendor/bin/sail artisan user:create-admin user@email.tld Username
```

This command will return the url to a registration page, where the user can set up a password and their 2-factor-authentication.

### Emails

By default, the application sends the emails to the log file. To debug or view the emails in a nice interface you can
use the supplied MailPit container. This container will catch all outgoing emails and show them in a web interface.
To use this you need to make some changes in your `.env` file:
```dotenv
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=mailpit
MAIL_PORT=1025
```
After this change you can view the emails by browsing to [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)
